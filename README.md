# Character-Recognition-using-Backpropagation

This project is based on character recognition i.e. english alphabets(both capital and small) and digits.
It trains the 3 layer(1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer) neural network using backpropagation and 
update the weights to minimize error.
Dataset is used from MNIST site(https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19).
